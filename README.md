Overview

The Smart Parking Management System consists of a network of IoT sensors that are placed in each parking spot. These sensors detect the presence of a vehicle and send this information to a central server. The server then processes this data and provides real-time information to drivers about available parking spots through a mobile app or website.

Features

Some of the key features of this Smart Parking Management System include:

Real-time monitoring of parking spot availability
Automated billing and payment system for parking fees
Integration with popular mapping services to provide directions to available parking spots
Automated alerts for parking violations or unauthorized use
Easy integration with existing parking infrastructure
Technologies Used

This Smart Parking Management System is built using the following technologies:

Python for the server-side code
Arduino for the IoT sensor code
MQTT protocol for communication between the sensors and server
Google Maps API for mapping and directions
Flask for the web framework
Bootstrap for the front-end design
Installation

To install this Smart Parking Management System, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-parking-system.git.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the root directory.
Connect the IoT sensors to the network and configure the MQTT broker settings in the config.ini file.
Start the server by running python server.py in the root directory.
Usage

To use this Smart Parking Management System, follow these steps:

Open the mobile app or website and search for available parking spots.
Once you have found an available spot, navigate to it using the provided directions.
Park your vehicle in the designated spot.
The IoT sensor will detect the presence of your vehicle and send this information to the server.
When you are ready to leave, simply drive away from the parking spot.
The IoT sensor will detect the absence of your vehicle and send this information to the server.
The server will calculate the parking fee based on the duration of your stay and send a notification to your mobile app or email.
Pay the parking fee through the mobile app or website.
